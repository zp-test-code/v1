Future Robotics Club, or FuRoC in short, develops from a student club that is made up of undergraduates from Tsinghua University, focusing on advanced robots, artificial intelligence technology and the related fields.

Future Robotics Club currently has more than 50 members, covering more than ten faculties, including automation, electronics, computers, software, precision instrument, electrical machinery, machinery, academy of aviation, and academy of fine arts. Together, we have established an interest-oriented and project-based team. Through project development, technology sharings, regular meetings, participations in international competitions and other activities, we maintain attention to the research dynamics and industrial development of robot-related fields at home and abroad, as well as continuous attempts to advanced technologies. Our team is a place for students to give play to their strengths and interest, and to grow together.

Here, you can find students from a huge variety of subjects, including Conputer Science, Electronic Engineering, Automation, Mechanical Engineering, etc

Tinker is a special team chosen from FuRoC, it consist of elite members who actively make contribution to FuRoC. Tinker participates in a lot of worldwide competitions each year.
